 what is vm
    how to create vm in the cloud using compute service--EC2
   ec2 is compute service provided by aws 
   used to launch virtual server at the speific data center as az in regioin
steps: login as root user--services--compute -ec2--name and tag- choose ami--redhat-instance type-
-create the key-pair(.pem)--choose network ---choose storage--launch-view instance-go to
instance window--select the instance name--connect--ssh-client--copy ssh

ssh -i "MYOS.pem" ec2-user@publicdns-go the download directory where our .pem file saved-
cmd-paste the command at command promprt--it will ask prompt--enter "yes"---> now os is
launched and start to practice the commands.

HOW TO MANAGE THIS USERS:
*****************************************
1)creating users and groups on each and every host manually

2) centralize the users in the corporate dirctory :LDAP,AD

technique for connecting to remote server:
*********************************************
what is  putty:
*******************

       is a graphical tool 
      is a ssh and telnet based tool
  used to connect to the remote server via graphical window

 1) download the putty ,puttygen
2) at the time of launching the ec2 server, user will get .pem file
3) open putty gen--click "load" --browse the path of pem file
4)accept some alerts
 5) save privatekey file as filename.ppk
 6) go to ec2 server --details tab--copy the public ip or public dns
  7)open putty
  8) enter ip address or hostname,select ssh and enter port no:22--ssh--auth--credentials--browse the private key file ---open-
    login as --ec2-user
 
exercise:
**************
   login to remote server-like ec2 with usename called urname and set the password...


what is nologin shell:
*********************

certailn application accounts doesnt require login to access the system in the network
in certain conditions admin also create the normal users with out login shelll

  practice:

      1) sudo useradd  -s /sbin/nologin mrsrinivas
     2) sudo passwd username
    3) su - username
   4) verify the o/p and u could get the following info "the current account is not available"


  to set back from nologin shell to login shell:
**************************************************
   open  /etc/passwd file
 edit the following line at user: username:x:uid:gid:comment:/bin/bash

  pkill is a command used to kill process based on name
 what is the diff between killall and pkill
pgrep is command to search the pid of speific process
  pgrep process

sleep 10000&----> will create a job in the background with specific job id and start running
sleep 20000&

what is the use of black-hole/bit-bucket:
**********************************************
is a file called /dev/null
used to discard the output on the screen

ex: yes > /dev/null &
nice 
renice
default value of nice is : 0

range : -19 to 0 to 20
 low value(-10) gives high priority---high cpu allocated
high value(+10) gives low priority--less cpu allocated
